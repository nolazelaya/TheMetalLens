The Metal Lens Podcast!

Pet project of mine - an expensive hobby, really -  with my buddy Troy from back when we used to play music together. We discuss the good ol' days, music we're listening to, news in the local New Orleans (and global) heavy metal scene, science, technology...whatever we happen to find interesting.
